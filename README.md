## Simple Clock Web Application

### Overview
This project creates a basic web application using Python (Flask/Django) to display a simple clock interface.

### Setup Instructions
1. **Web Framework Setup:**
   - Choose a Python web framework (e.g., Flask, Django) and set up a development environment.
   - Install necessary dependencies using `pip install flask` (for Flask) or `pip install django` (for Django).

2. **Application Logic:**
   - Implement clock functionality using JavaScript (optional) or server-side rendering.
   - Design a user-friendly interface to display the current time.

3. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the application to a web server or cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS) for public access.

### Usage
- Users can view the current time in a browser window, with potential extensions for alarms, time zone conversion, etc.
- Customize the design and features based on user feedback and requirements.
